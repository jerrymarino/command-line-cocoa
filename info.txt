## Debugging:

LLDB works really nice from the command line

    # Attach LLDB to a given process
    $lldb   -attach-name fruitstrap-demo

    # Set a breakpoint for an objc method
    (lldb) br s -S fire:

    # Continue to the next line in a breakpoint
    (lldb)n

    # Continue
    (lldb)c

    # Stop
    (lldb)ctrl-c

    # Show all breakpoints
    (lldb) br list

    # Disable all breakpoints
    (lldb) br disable

    # Enable all breakpoints
    (lldb) br enable


There is also a lldb plugin for vim https://github.com/gilligan/vim-lldb 

## Simulator Log Reading

It is possible to tail the simulator by opening the logs:

    # Read the system log of the simulator
    $ tail -f ~/Library/Logs/iOS\ Simulator/7.0.3/system.log

Imagine all of the possiblities:

    # Read the system log of the simulator
    $ tail -f ~/Library/Logs/iOS\ Simulator/7.0.3/system.log | grep SomeString
